Basic Probability concepts

-Sample Space and Events
    -Sample space: The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.
    -Events: A subset of the sample space.

-Conditional Probability
    -The probability of an event A occurring, given that B has occurred.

-Independence
    -Two events A and B are independent if
        - P(A intersection B) = P(A).P(B)


Random VAriables

    What are random variables?
    -Maps outcomes of a random experiment to numerical values.
    -Types: Discrete | Continuous

Probability Mass Function(PMF)
    -Probability distribution of a discrete random variable.

Probability Density Function(PDF)
    -Probability distribution of a continuous random variable.


Expectation, Variance and Standard Deviation

-Expectation(E[X])
    -Weighted average of a random variable's possible values.

-Variance(Var[X])
    -Measures the spread of a random variable.
        Var[X] = E[(X-E[X]^2)]

-Standard Deviation(sigmaX)
    -Square root of variance:
        sigmaX = (Var[X])^1/2
