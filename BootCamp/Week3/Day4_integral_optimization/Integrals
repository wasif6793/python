what are Integrals?
    -Compute the area under a curve, responding accumulation.
    -The definition integral of f(x) from a to b:

Applications in ML:
    - Probability Distributions
    - Cost functions


Optimisation Concepts

-Local vs. Global Minima
    -Local Minimum
    -Global Minimum

-Convex functions
    -Ensure that any local minimum is also  a global minimum.
    -

-Non-Convex functions in ML
    -Most neural networks loss functions.


Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) and its Variants
-What is Stochastic Gradient Descent?
    -Optimisation algorithm that uses random subsets(mini-batches) of the data to
     compute gradients and update parameters.

-Why use SGDs?


-Varients of SGD
    -Mini-Batch SGD
    -Momentum
    -Adam Optimizer
